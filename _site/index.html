                        </ul>

                    <p>I don't know which one of my co-conspirators came up with the idea, but it all started with a simple premise:</p>

<p><strong>"A new coding project every week"</strong></p>

<p>Madness! Surely it couldn't be possible. What would that even involve?</p>

<p>I had so many questions, but as we discussed it we started to come to something resembling an agreement. We wanted to:</p>

<ul>
<li>introduce more developers to open-source projects and help them learn the ropes.</li>
<li>foster a community that encouraged contributions across a range of technologies.</li>
<li>work on projects which the community want to improve.</li>
</ul>


<p> Of course, that doesn't get away from the original question I had.</p>

<p> <strong>Why a week?</strong></p>

<p> A week isn't a long time - or it may be, depending on your perspective. This is still a somewhat contentious point within the group, but a week suits me because:</p>

<ul>
<li>shorter timelines encourage achievable goals.</li>
<li>shorter timelines reduce the incentive to procrastinate.</li>
<li>more variety of projects to work on - something different each week.</li>
<li>with good organisation, each week should be productive out of the gate.</li>
</ul>


<p> But there are some things we need to address first:</p>

<p> <strong>What next?</strong></p>

<p>We need to work out:</p>

<ul>
<li>how do we determine which projects to work on?</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control">DVCS</a> is still a relatively new concept - how can we help getting new developers familiar with it?</li>
<li>how do we organise each project? We want to give value both to the project owners and the contributors.</li>
</ul>


<p> We want to <strong>build fun stuff</strong>, <strong>give back</strong> to the projects who have helped us over the years, and <strong>create a community</strong> around our crazy ideas.</p>

<p> So whatever your background and skillset, if you want to get involved and learn from others in the community, we'd love to hear from you.</p>

<p> So drop in on our <a href="http://code52.uservoice.org">UserVoice</a> channel and suggest or vote on projects, discuss your ideas and suggestions on the <a href="http://code52.tenderapp.com">TenderApp</a> site, and follow us on <a href="http://twitter.com/code52_org">Twitter</a> to hear more about it.</p>
