code52 started with a simple idea:

##"A new coding project every week"

We want to **build fun stuff** in our spare time, **give back** to projects which need support, and **create a community** which is inclusive and engaging. 

##Who's behind this idea?

We are (in alphabetical order) [Andrew Tobin](http://twitter.com/tobin), [Brendan Forster](http://twitter.com/shiftkey) and [Paul Jenkins](http://twitter.com/aeoth). 

Particular goals we want to achieve:

 - introduce developers to open-source projects and help them learn the ropes.
 - contribute to projects across a range of technologies.
 - let the community determine where to focus efforts (?).

##Why a week?

We're still nailing down the details at the moment, but in particular:

 - shorter timelines encourage achievable goals.
 - shorter timelines reduce the incentive to procrastinate.
 - more variety of projects to work on over a period of time.

##How can I find out more?

You can nominate and vote for projects on our [Uservoice](http://code52.uservoice.com) site.

Discussions, ideas and suggestions can be posted on our [TenderApp](http://code52.tenderapp.com) site.

And we're on [Twitter](http://twitter/code_52)!
