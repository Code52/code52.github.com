What can you expect from day one of a brand new project? Not much, right? Wrong. Awesomeness is what you should expect. The first <strike>sucker</strike> up to the plate was [@distantcam](https://twitter.com/#!/distantcam) who setup the Caliburn.Micro framework, hooked up MarkdownSharp and we were well on our way to getting a workable utility.

Initially we were using a plain textbox as the editor, but quickly discovered the powerful [AvalonEdit](http://www.avalonedit.net/) control from SharpDevelop.

17 commits for day one? Not shabby.
