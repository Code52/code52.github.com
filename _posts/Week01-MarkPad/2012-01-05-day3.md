> The first few days of the first project (MarkPad) were retroactively blogged about because we only decided to do that *after* the fact.

While day two was "slow", day three was anything but. An icon, a UI overhaul, and so many features.

###The Logo
One of the good and bad things about an adhoc, democratic app is that everybody has a say. This has led to some great UI or logic choices, but on the flipside has also had a few instances of where nobody could agree and executive decisions has to be made. For the icon, we had two shapes and many colours to pick from!

###UI overhaul
It was voted that the anything resembling the "Fluent UI" (Ribbon) should be nuked from orbit, and instead we opted to go for a metro look. Thankfully, we all knew a guy who knew a guy who had a [WPF Metro Library](http://www.theleagueofpaul.com/metro).

The design was inspired by (and permitted!) [ClindHartsen](https://twitter.com/#!/clindhartsen)'s "[Focus Text Editor](http://clindhartsen.deviantart.com/art/Focus-Text-Editor-176271501)"

We also introduced [Awesomium](http://awesomium.com/) as the preview control to make up for the lacking capabilities of the build in WPF WebBrowser (which is really just IE in an ActiveX/COM wrapper)
