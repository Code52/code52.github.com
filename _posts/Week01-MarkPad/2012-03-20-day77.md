MarkPad might be getting a little "long in the tooth" for a Code52 project but it is still one of the most actively developed projects we have.

If we go back to what we had going on [*day one*](/weekone-dayone.html), it'd be fair to say it was ugly - not an unusual situation with open source applications, particularly in the "v1" stage.

While we may not be designers or trained in the blackarts of UX, we've made a real effort to give UI/UX the respect it deserves.

While the UI is cleaner and dare I say it - prettier - what else has been going on in the land of MarkPad? A quick highlight

* Font selection (size/type) for the editor
* Incorrect spelling detection
* "Jekyll" detection which allows pasting of images straight into the editor, which copies it to the right folder
* Discussion and the beginnings of an *extension* framework!
* wyUpdate/wyBuild auto-updater in the works

Once we get extensions (powered by NuGet!) and app updater going, MarkPad will be an unstoppable Markdown juggernaut!
