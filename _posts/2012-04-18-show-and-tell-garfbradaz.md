## Introduction

This post is from Gareth Bradley, who found the Code52 chatroom by accident while he was checking out [JabbR](http://jabbr.net/). When we announced the "Show and Tell" week, he wrote a post about what he does for a living and what [he's been learning in his spare time](http://garfbradazweb.wordpress.com/2012/04/16/code52-show-tell-my-open-source-application/).

I share the same view as Gareth in that I **learn best by building something useful** - and Gareth's put together his own OSS project as a way to demonstrate what he's learned.

The project code is at [mvcimage.codeplex.com](http://mvcimage.codeplex.com/), and I hope to see more cool stuff from him in the future.
