## Introduction

This post is from Gareth, who found the Code52 chatroom by chance. When we announced the "Show and Tell" week, he put together a post about what he does for a living and what [he's been learning in his spare time](http://garfbradazweb.wordpress.com/2012/04/16/code52-show-tell-my-open-source-application/).

I share the same view as Gareth in that I **learn best by building something useful** - and Gareth's put together his own OSS project to demonstrate his learning.

The project code is at [mvcimage.codeplex.com](http://mvcimage.codeplex.com/), and I hope to see more stuff from him in the future.

## About the Author

Gareth is a 4GL applications developer for OpenVMS systems by day and learns various other technologies (including C#, C++, XNA and ASP.NET) by night. You can find his blog at [garfbradazweb.wordpress.com/](http://garfbradazweb.wordpress.com/) and he isn't on Twitter (but probably should be).
