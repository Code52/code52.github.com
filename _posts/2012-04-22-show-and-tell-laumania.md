## Introduction

Mads sent through a blog post yesterday about how his experiment on porting a game from Silverlight to XNA.

His starting point: a game called "We are Bugs" from [Jeff Weber](http://www.farseergames.com/). 

You can go and play it [here](http://www.farseergames.com/wearebugs). I'll wait.

Back? Great. So Jeff made the source code [available](http://www.farseergames.com/blog/2009/4/30/we-are-bugs-refactored-and-source-released.html) a while ago, and Mads has experimented with porting the code to Silverlight in WP7 and then in XNA.

[His results are up on GitHub](https://github.com/Laumania/WeAreBugs-XNA) for those who want to compare and contrast the differences.
