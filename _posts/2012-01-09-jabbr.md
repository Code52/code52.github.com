After the success of the [first week](http://code52.org/downmarker-review.html) and being [Hanselman'd](https://twitter.com/#!/shanselman/status/156270525935656960) , we found ourselves at a bit of a crossroad with what to take on next.

The Git for Windows idea is the most popular idea on the list, but we have some contributors who were relatively new to Git, and we'd rather ease them into using Git rather than throwing them under the Git bus.

So the group in the chatroom started discussing other ideas over the course of today, and settled on another which would help us with our projects.

 -I want to see about a GitHub pull request without needing an email notification.

 -I want an issue discussed in Jabbr to be logged in GitHub automatically.

 -I want to see an idea suggest in Jabbr be tracked in UserVoice without remembering to re-enter the data.

This project borrows code from [David Fowler's](http://twitter.com/davidfowl) work on the [Jabbot](http://github.com/davidfowl/jabbot) and some inspiration from [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com/).

We want a bot to listen into a JabbR chat room 24-7 to follow the action and execute tasks in the background. We want to write extensions to integrate with the systems we use to run projects. And we want to automate the boring bits.

There's already a number of features [suggested](https://github.com/code52/jibbr/issues) - so go suggest yours too before its too late.

Want to get involved? Drop in to [JabbR](http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/code52) and join in!
