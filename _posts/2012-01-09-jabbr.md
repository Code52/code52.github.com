After the [success](http://code52.org/week1-recap.html) of the first week, we found ourselves at a bit of a crossroad with what to take on next.

 - The Git for Windows idea is the most popular idea on the list.
 - We had some contributors who were relatively new to Git.
 - We spent much of yesterday discussing on JabbR what we wanted to implement and were concerned about the possible scope of work.

While this was all happening, the JabbR website on AppHarbor was having some uptime issues which was a distraction to the team.

A distraction that sparked another idea.

We've been using JabbR as our main communication channel for the past week (we had TenderApp set up but gravitated towards JabbR as it felt much closer to IM for communicating) and it's been a lot of fun to use.

But a couple of things have been missing from the current version of JabbR:

 - Mobile Device support - we have some WP7 users, and they've had issues navigating to the JabbR site in mobile IE9. May be the case for other users too.
 - Export History - JabbR has some excellent archive support (scroll to the top of the page to go back in the history logs) but lacks a hook to extract the history from a chatroom.
 - ???
