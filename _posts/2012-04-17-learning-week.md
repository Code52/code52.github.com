The Code52 organisers want to unveil an idea, but first we want to test out our theory with a little experiment. And it involves you.

## Some Background

Since we kicked off Code52 at the start of the year, we've talked with many developers who are keen to get involved with OSS development but don't really have the time to dedicate a full week to working on a specific idea.

Does that sound like you? Well this is your week.

We want to hear what you have been working with in your spare time. We want to hear about the cool stuff we haven't had a chance to use. We want to get jealous of how you've used it and what you've learned.

In short, we want to hear your stories.

## Show and Tell

We're looking for people to write short articles on stuff they've used recently or something they've built recently to share with the big wide world.

We want to hear:

 - what did you find that is awesome?
 - what is awesome about it?
 - how did you use it?
 - what did you learn from using it?
 - is there some code that people can have a play with?

It doesn't have to be a long post. And things like pictures and code snippets are fine to help show it off.

Already written about something cool you'd like to share? Tweet a link to the [@Code_52](http://twitter.com/Code_52) account and we'll get in touch. If we're suitably impressed by your awesomeness, we'll send it out to the world.

Don't have a blog? Don't worry! You can fork [this website](http://github.com/Code52/code52.github.com) on GitHub and add your own post to the [posts folder](http://github.com/Code52/code52.github.com/tree/master/_posts). Once you've written the post, send us a pull request and we can proof-read it before pushing it live. 

If you haven't seen it before, the site layout and content is used by a tool called [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) to create the site content.

The Code52 gang have built a couple of tools which might help with writing the posts - [MarkPad](http://code52.org/DownmarkerWPF) for writing Markdown content and [Pretzel](http://code52.org/pretzel) for testing the site locally. You should check them out!
