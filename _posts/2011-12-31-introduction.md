I don't know which one of my co-conspirators came up with the idea, but it all started with a simple premise:

**"A new coding project every week"**

Madness! Surely it couldn't be possible. What would that even involve? 

I had so many questions, but as we discussed it we started to come to something resembling an agreement. We wanted to:

 - introduce more developers to open-source projects and help them learn the ropes.
 - foster a community that encouraged contributions across a range of technologies.
 - work on projects which the community want to improve.

 Of course, that doesn't get away from the original question I had. 

 **Why a week?**

 A week isn't a long time - or it may be, depending on your perspective. This is still a somewhat contentious point within the group, but a week suits me because:

 - shorter timelines encourage achievable goals.
 - shorter timelines reduce the incentive to procrastinate.
 - more variety of projects to work on - something different each week.
 - with good organisation, each week should be productive out of the gate.

 But there are some things we need to address first:

 **What next?**

We need to work out:

 - how do we determine which projects to work on?
 - [DVCS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control) is still a relatively new concept - how can we help getting new developers familiar with it?
 - how do we organise each project? We want to give value both to the project owners and the contributors.

 We want to **build fun stuff**, **give back** to the projects who have helped us over the years, and **create a community** around our crazy ideas.

 So whatever your background and skillset, if you want to get involved and learn from others in the community, we'd love to hear from you.

 So drop in on our [UserVoice](http://code52.uservoice.org) channel and suggest or vote on projects, discuss your ideas and suggestions on the [TenderApp](http://code52.tenderapp.com) site, and follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/code52_org) to hear more about it.
