title: "An introduction to code52"
---

I don't know which one of my co-conspirators came up with the idea, but it all started with a simple premise:

"A new project every week"

Madness! Surely it couldn't be possible. What would that even involve? I had so many questions, but as we discussed it we started to come to something resembling an agreement.

We wanted:

 - to introduce more developers to open-source projects and help them learn the ropes.
 - to create a community that encouraged contributions across a broad range of technologies.
 - to work on projects which both the creators and community want to improve.

 Of course, that doesn't get away from the original question I had. 

 **Why a week?**

 Depending on your perspective, a week may be a long time - or it may not. This is still a contentious point within our group, but a week suits me because:

 - shorter timelines encourage achievable goals.
 - shorter timelines reduce the incentive to procrastinate.
 - more variety of projects to work on - something different each week.
 - with good organisation (i.e. us having our shit together), each week should be productive out of the gate.










 - lots of projects out there are in need of contributons
 - people have good ideas
