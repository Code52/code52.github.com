title: "An introduction to code52"
---

I don't know which one of my co-conspirators came up with the idea, but it all started with a simple premise:

**"A new coding project every week"**

Madness! Surely it couldn't be possible. What would that even involve? 

I had so many questions, but as we discussed it we started to come to something resembling an agreement.

We wanted to:

 - introduce more developers to open-source projects and help them learn the ropes.
 - foster a community that encouraged contributions across a range of technologies.
 - work on projects which the community want to improve.

 Of course, that doesn't get away from the original question I had. 

 **Why a week?**

 A week isn't a long time - or it may be, depending on your perspective. This is still a somewhat contentious point within our group, but a week suits me because:

 - shorter timelines encourage achievable goals.
 - shorter timelines reduce the incentive to procrastinate.
 - more variety of projects to work on - something different each week.
 - with good organisation (i.e. us having our shit together), each week should be productive out of the gate.

 And yes, we're anticipating some hurdles getting something like this off the ground.

 **What sort of hurdles?**

Given the variety of backgrounds and skillsets that developers have, we need to keep in mind:

 - how do we determine which projects to work on 
 - [DVCS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control) is still a very new concept - how can we help getting new developers familiar with it
