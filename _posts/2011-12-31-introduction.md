This all started with a simple premise:

##"A new coding project every week"

Madness! I was hooked and [gobsmacked](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gobsmacked) at the same time. I had so many questions, and as we discussed it we started to come to something resembling an agreement. 

##Who's behind this idea?

We are (in alphabetical order) [Andrew Tobin](http://twitter.com/tobin), [Brendan Forster](http://twitter.com/shiftkey) and [Paul Jenkins](http://twitter.com/aeoth). 

##What are your goals?

We want to:

 - introduce developers to open-source projects and help them learn the ropes.
 - foster a community which encouraged contributions across a range of technologies.
 - work on projects which the community (i.e. YOU) want to improve.

 Of course, that doesn't get away from the original question I had. 

##Why a week?

 A week isn't a long time - or it may be, depending on your perspective. This is still a somewhat contentious point within the group, but a week suits me because:

 - shorter timelines encourage achievable goals.
 - shorter timelines reduce the incentive to procrastinate.
 - more variety of projects to work on over a period of time.
 - with good organisation, each week should be productive out of the gate.

##What next?

 But there are some things we need to address first:

 - how do we determine which projects to work on?
 - how do we organise each project? 
 - how do we (as co-ordinators) deal with the skill gap between experienced and junior developers?

 We want to **build fun stuff**, **give back** to the projects which have been useful to us, and potentially **create a community** around this crazy idea.  So whatever your background - if you want to get involved and work with others in the developer community, we'd love to hear from you.

 Do you have an project which suits this idea? [Vote on it](http://code52.uservoice.com)
