Please excuse the inane ramblings of somebody who doesn't usually use the DLR and was somewhat delirious when victory struck.  While it's not 100% yet, we have basic support for scripts from [Hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot), which means with a bit more work, we should get compatiblity with [the 150 or so in the community scripts repo!](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/tree/master/src/scripts)
