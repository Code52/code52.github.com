Technically we started this on Day 0 with forking the [Jabbot](http://github.com/davidfowl/jabbot) project and gathering ideas and features while people explored the code. Due to the Hanselman effect, we had an overflowing chatroom and lots of discussion to keep us busy. 

### Drawing

Paul was in the mood for drawing, and he started experimentign with Mr-T/Hubot themed graphics

### The Bleeding Edge

Oh, and there were some JabbR fun and games to deal with straight off the bat. Some breaking changes in the [JabbR](http://github.com/davidfowl/jabbr) website hadn't propogated to a [SignalR.Client](http://github.com/signalr/signalr) release - but thankfully the awesome [@davidfowl](https://twitter.com/davidfowl) was on hand to help us get the right commits together and craft a version which played nice.

### Experimenting with Sprockets

One of the first features we added was support for periodic sprockets - we're calling them *announcements* - but more work was needed to get the infrastructure to a point where people could experiment further. A simple scheduler was added to the console app, and a sample plugin - telling you what time it was in Sydney - was added to the code.

[Andrew](http://twitter.com/tobin) and [Stefan](http://twitter.com/cyberzeddk) also worked on adding support for additional commands to the bot, building test sprockets and running them in a test JabbR chatroom.

We started spawning test rooms to ensure the main Code52 chat room was not annoyed by out experiments. 

Even a Mr T bot made an appearance - I wish I had a screenshot handy of the bot making fun of me.

### Hosting

We discussed where this hypothetical app would be hosted - a Windows Service was discussed, but we eventually agreed that it *should* be fine to host on ASP.NET. The [NancyFx](http://twitter.com/TheCodeJunkie) [guys](http://twitter.com/GrumpyDev) were in the JabbR chatroom to steer us in the right direction.
