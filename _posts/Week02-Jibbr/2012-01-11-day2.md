More momentum, more interest, more progress.

### JabbR Updates

Some changes to JabbR and SignalR - [David](http://twitter.com/davidfowl) (and I suppose [Damian](http://twitter.com/damianedwards) by extension) is planning a 0.4 version of SignalR. More changes to JabbR and SignalR pulled into Jibbr.

### GitHub Announcements

Most of the heavy-lifting for the GitHub plugin is done - using JSON.NET's dynamic support to parse data from the GitHub API without defining strongly-typed models makes this about eleventy billion times easier. 


The plugin is intended to track:

 - notifications about commits to the master repository
 - notifications about people watching the project
 - notifications about pull requests (new and closed ones)
 - activity notifications for forks off the master repository - when a new one is created, when code has been pushed to it
 - notifications for issues


### Jabbot running on Nancy

[Seth Webster](http://www.sethwebster.com/) a contributor to the Jabbot project, put together a simple sample app of a Jabber bot running inside NancyFx. He's also been helping out with the JabbR testing over the past couple of days. Many thanks for his hard work.

[Paul](http://twitter.com/aeoth) has taken that sample and started working on an administration tool for the bot:
