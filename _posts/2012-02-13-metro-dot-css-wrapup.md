##Features
As we mentioned at the start, metro.css is built on the basis of Twitter's Bootstrap. We haven't pulled in a huge amount, just what we need - including the bootstrap grid/layout system.

###Fonts
Fonts are hard. Eventually we settled on three similar fonts to use for various platforms, with roboto being the fallback.

###Colours
All the colours of the... metro-bow?

###Controls
There is a pivot control as well as a tile layout system with tilt on mouse-press (although only in Webkit browsers for now)

###Whats next?

* We will (eventually) migrate code52 to using metro.css - a decent whack of styles came from code52 as it was!
* There are still a stack of tasks on the [trello board](https://trello.com/board/metro-css/4f2fd841a5146fa91fbff127) before we'd consider this a "done" project - I'd personally love to see the gh-pages template knocked up so more projects can use that (rather than the makeshift template we created that [a few are starting to use](http://signalr.net/))

##Contributors
The turn out for metro.css has been - to say the least - disappointing. While it had a modest 36 votes, just three outside of the Code52 team turned up. We've had many declare that we're shooting ourselves in the foot for "restricting" ourselves to .NET or just Windows projects, this was the first project that had no platform restrictions... yet few showed up. While we won't say no to cross platform or an alternative project, it certainly will make us more hesitant!
