After an epic week doing game development (which for many of us was new territory), we've picked a project which revisits one of languages we use everywhere with Code52 - Markdown.

## Pretzel

Code52 are big fans of [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), the Ruby-based static site generator tool. In fact, the site you are reading leverages output from Jekyll (running on GitHub too - check out the code [here](https://github.com/code52/code52.github.com)) and all our project sites run on top of the same stack (more details [here](http://code52.org/gh-pages.html)).

To develop locally against Jekyll, you need to install ruby and configure your environment to install the right set of gems. **We want to create a tool in this vein which is more friendly for .NET developers - and support for the technologies that they use so that they too can quickly create sites.**

We also want to explore implementing features on top of this Jekyll-like workflow:

 * support different templating engines - Razor/Spark/???
 * support dynamic content alongside static content - for example using a custom commenting solution instead of Disqus.
 * support for different inputs - could we generate documentation for code using this tool?

## Why Pretzel?

We were discussing on JabbR what to name this tool, and someone described the process of generating a site as "baking". A few minutes later, we'd settled on the name "Pretzel" for the tool, rather than some derivative of Jekyll and Hyde.

Conceptually, Pretzel could support two modes - **bake** and **taste**. 

**Bake** is for a once-off generation of the site.

To scan the current directory for a website and detect the content to process, run:

    pretzel bake 

To scan a specific folder and parse the contents, run:

    pretzel bake C:\path\to\folder

To explicitly specify the input - we should support inferring the input based on the files found anyway - run:

    pretzel bake --engine jekyll
    
**Taste** is for testing a site locally using a browser - make a change, and Pretzel should detect the file changes and regenerate the site.

To test a site locally (we plan to use [Dragonfly](https://github.com/loudej/dragonfly)), run:

	pretzel taste 

To specify the port to serve the site from (default will be 4000), run:

    pretzel taste --port 5000


There's more ideas that we'll get to over teh course of the week, but this should give people an idea of how the tool should behave.


## How can I get involved?

The initial code is up on [GitHub](http://github.com/Code52/pretzel) (Samurai is the codename for the project, because [Brendan](http://twitter.com/shiftkey) is a sucker for a good random name generator). The [Trello board](https://trello.com/board/pretzel/4f25ffb3dbbed1ab5a4f0f5a) is being cultivated to define the tasks necessary to hit the ground running.

This post may be a bit brief, but that's because so much is in flux currently and people's creative juices are just starting to flow.
