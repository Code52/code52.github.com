## Introduction

Ever come across a blog post from ancient history which includes an attachment that you really really need, but the link no longer works? [This post](http://davidburela.wordpress.com/2012/04/17/developer-blog-banter-3-responsecommunity-coding/) is for you.

David Burela did a writeup this week on: 
 
 - how he used to manage code samples with his blog posts 
 - the problems and limitations of this approach
 - how he is using GitHub to make life easier for himself and his readers

He explains how you can create your own repositories and include documentation, and references a [Windows Phone application](https://github.com/DavidBurela/Windows8DeveloperCampPhoneApplication) he wrote recently.

David also mentions [MarkPad](http://code52.org/DownmarkerWPF)- an application built by the Code52 community to make writing Markdown-based files easier.
