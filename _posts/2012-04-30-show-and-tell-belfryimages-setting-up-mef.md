## Setting up MEF

Ben posted yesterday about [setting up MEF](http://blog.belfryimages.com.au/setting-up-mef.html) with the goal of adding plugins to a simple application. It touches on splitting the plugin API from the application code, including two-way communication between the application and the plugin. This method will possibly be used to implement plugin support in [MarkPad](http://code52.org/DownmarkerWPF/).

The project created for the post is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/belfryimages/mef-test).
