##This week's idea

Two weeks down, and the momentum is strong - we've got a packed room over at [Jabbr](http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/code52), we've been featured on the [Github blog](https://github.com/blog/1024-a-new-coding-project-every-week-at-code52), and we've got two projects that are going strong.

So now we're on to week three, and another idea from our community - [Ideastrike!](https://github.com/Code52/Ideastrike) (code to go up soon ;))

**Our aim this week is to create a great site to give ideas and feedback, focusing on software development and good integration with other tooling.**

There are many feedback and voting mechanism for ideas, but we think we can provide an open-source alternative, that is feature rich, simple, but powerful, and will be a great asset for the small guys trying to get started on projects.

Here's an initial mockup from [@aeoth](http://twitter.com/aeoth) about how this might look.

We've got a [Trello board](https://trello.com/board/ideastrike/4f137b417201526045146b8a) set up which we'll use to track the backlog of features and who's currently working on what feature - if you want access to the repository to help out, drop into the [JabbR](http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/code52) chatroom and get in touch.

## What platform are we looking at?

Well, we've had a lot of feedback this week about this being a ".NET only" group - we don't intend it to be that way, but as it was said on [The West Wing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing) - "Decisions are made by those who show up".

We're looking for the primary group to start working with an ASP.NET framework - [Nancy](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy) as it's what some of us are familiar with, and what we think others with .NET experience will get up to speed on quicky.  We also benefit from two [exceptional](https://twitter.com/grumpydev) [guys](https://twitter.com/thecodejunkie) who have been, and we hope will be, stopping by to offer support and advice.

That being said, if some of the other communities out there - be it Java, Ruby, Python, Node.JS, Haskell, Erlang or Perl want to get involved - stop by, help us make decisions, and gather a group and code.

We're happy to *have* help, we're happy *to* help.

One idea we've had is if we collaboratively work on a set of specifications, so we can jointly create something that works cross-platform, for different scenarios and different communities - but a shared reference.

We're happy to discuss it, to offer support, publicity where we can, but what we need is - if you're serious about contributing and you want to make this more than just about .NET, we need you to show up.

##So what now?

We'll be getting some code set up on the github in the next 24 hours, and discussing approaches and drawing up a battle plan in the chatroom - if you've got ideas you want, come in and discuss them with us (ping @aeoth, @shifty and @tobin in the room please), or leave a message on this blog post.

Get into the chatroom at [JabbR](http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/code52) and join in on the fun!
