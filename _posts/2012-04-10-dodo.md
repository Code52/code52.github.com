A few weeks ago, we had a discussion about building a Twitter app. As a group with [history](http://www.theleagueofpaul.com/mahtweets-is-dead) in building apps, we didn't want to do something conventional - and with Windows 8 being focused on the tablet space we started down a different path. This quickly became one of our [hot ideas](https://code52.uservoice.com/forums/143105-code-52/suggestions/2673882-metro-style-twitter-client) and we've had lots of people asking when we're going to kick it off.

### Capturing the madness

Rather than use JabbR to capture the discussion, we used **sync.in** to write down and edit our ideas. Aside from a minor hiccup with the cap on concurrent users, we had a productive hour or two discussing ideas in real-time and having a nicely formatted document at the end.

The results of this can be found [here](http://sync.in/KlhETAjkLy) and those will be tranformed into the backlog for tasks to acheive this week.

### Goals

To identify some broad goals for the week:

 - the project should ship a reusable Twitter library as well as a client
 - the client will not follow the existing norms of displaying lists of tweets
 - the client should demonstrate some wicked animations and transitions
 - the client should implement some radical features for other Twitter clients to shamelessly steal

### Get Involved

We've started a skeleton of the app (it should allow you to authenticate and render some tweets) on [GitHub](https://github.com/Code52/dodo) and the [Trello board](https://trello.com/board/dodo/4f82e9dfc10221fb0db2cff2) has some initial tasks which are small enough to be started if people are curious. Got some ideas? There's people in the [JabbR](http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/code52) room to discuss ideas with.
